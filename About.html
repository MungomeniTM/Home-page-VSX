            <h1>About VSXchangeZA</h1>
            <p>
                VSXchangeZA was founded by <strong>Tshidzula Mulisa Mungomeni</strong>, 
                a visionary who believes that <em>"the future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                This platform was developed to address the <strong>vocational skills gap</strong> 
                that should have been introduced at an early age in our education system. 
                We believe vocational training should be a core part of the South African school curriculum, 
                empowering young people with practical skills they can use to build their future.
            </p>
            <p>
                VSXchangeZA connects skilled professionals with those who need their services, 
                and also provides a space for learning, mentorship, and community growth. 
                Whether you're here to hire, learn, or collaborate â€” this is your space.
